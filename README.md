This is the project repo for CSE311 (Introduction to Database Systems). 

Although this course was taken by me a year ago, at the time I did not know much about the required software development practices. This will remain here just for giggles and as a memory for me to remind me of how much bad code I wrote once upon a time.

I am aware of most of the security issues and stupidity in this code. And it is not a very DRY code. Also, no comments! Ugh.

In case you want to try out the code, you need to have XAMPP installed on your system. NO WARRANTY!

1. Navigate to http://localhost/phpmyadmin/ from your browser.
2. Create a database with the name "cse311onlineshop" in MySQL
3. Import the /database/cse311onlineshop.sql file into this database.
4. Start up Apache server from XAMPP control panel.
5. Navigate to "http://localhost/cse311onlineshop/" from your browser.
6. Be irritated, cringed. I guess.
